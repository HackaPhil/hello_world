I'm Philip. I do Compsci. That's all there is to know about me.
For now. But soon, you'll find out, inevitably
That there's more to me, than meets the eye; so much more to see. 
Cross me, and i'll put your lights out like i'm on the environmental commitee.
Look down on me, and i'll KO you like i'm Mohammed Ali. 
Actions speak louder than words, but imma still say this loud and clear. 
Past my kindess and nonchalance, i'm someone to fear.

Poem by Elon Musk, revised by Theresa May
